# Descriptive-and-Inferential-Statistics
A beginner-friendly Jupyter notebook covering key statistical concepts like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, IQR, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Includes step-by-step explanations and Python code for practice and verification.

# Introductory Statistics – Practice Notebook

This repository contains a single **Jupyter Notebook** that walks through ten concise, exam‑style problems covering core descriptive and inferential statistics.  
Each exercise is fully worked out with both manual calculations and well‑commented Python code (using the `statistics`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` libraries) so learners can see the logic **and** verify results programmatically.

## 📑 Contents / Topics Covered

| # | Concept | Question Focus |
|---|---------|----------------|
| **Q1** | **Key Statistical Definitions** | Population vs. Sample, Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics, Parameter vs. Statistic, Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data |
| **Q2** | **Measures of Central Tendency – Definitions** | Mean, Median, Mode (definitions + quick numeric illustration) |
| **Q3** | **Manual Central‑Tendency Calculations** | Step‑by‑step mean, median, mode for a 16‑element dataset |
| **Q4** | **Levels of Measurement** | Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio (definitions + examples) |
| **Q5** | **Variance & Standard Deviation – Theory** | Conceptual definitions, why SD is easier to interpret |
| **Q6** | **Manual Variance & SD Computation** | Sample variance and SD for a nine‑element dataset |
| **Q7** | **Range & Inter‑Quartile Range (IQR)** | Sorting data, computing range, Q1, Q3, and IQR |
| **Q8** | **Five‑Number Summary & Boxplot** | Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum; visual outlier detection |
| **Q9** | **Confidence Interval for a Mean** | 95 % CI using Z‑critical value for sample of 36 students |
| **Q10**| **Hypothesis Testing – One‑Sample Z‑Test** | Salary example, null/alt hypotheses, Z‑score, decision rule |

└── README.md # You are here

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.8  
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab / VS Code with Python extension  
* Libraries: `statistics`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` (pre‑installed with Anaconda; otherwise run `pip install numpy matplotlib`)  

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository.  
2. Launch Jupyter and open `stats_practice.ipynb`.  
3. Choose **Kernel ▸ Restart & Run All** to execute every cell.  
4. Scroll through each section to review the narrative explanation, manual math, and Python verification.

## ✏️ Learning Goals

By completing or reviewing the notebook you will be able to:

* Distinguish core statistical terms and data types.  
* Compute and interpret measures of central tendency and variability.  
* Construct and read a boxplot, identifying potential outliers.  
* Build a two‑sided confidence interval for a population mean.  
* Perform a one‑sample Z‑test and state conclusions at a given significance level.
